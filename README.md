## Installation
Do not use it as of now. This is just a first working version, that reads all the sensors


## Special thanks

Special thanks to [Solaredge Modbus](https://github.com/binsentsu/home-assistant-solaredge-modbus) and [Daikin Onecta](https://github.com/jwillemsen/daikin_onecta). 
A lot of this code is based off those repositories.
